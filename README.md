# RC-object-avoiding-robot
Lab project for microprocessor-based digital systems, developed in a Nucleo-L152RE in C languaje with the STM32 IDE
The Lab project consists in the development of a robot with an obstacle detection mechanism. The functionalities that are sought are the following:
o Movement forward and backward in a straight line
o Speed selection
o Turn to both sides
o Measurement of the distance to an obstacle when the robot is moving forward
o Stop the movement of the robot when an obstacle is detected at less than 10 cm
o Reduce the speed of the robot progressively when an obstacle is detected at less than 20 cm
o Generate acoustic signals depending on the proximity of the obstacle
o Communication with a device (PC or mobile phone), which includes receiving commands
o Bluetooth communication with a mobile phone that controls the robot movement

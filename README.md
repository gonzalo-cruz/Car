# RC-object-avoiding-robot
Lab project for microprocessor-based digital systems, developed in a Nucleo-L152RE in C languaje with the STM32 IDE
The Lab project consists in the development of a robot with an obstacle detection mechanism. The functionalities that are sought are the following:

  - Movement forward and backward in a straight line
  - Speed selection
  - Turn to both sides
  - Measurement of the distance to an obstacle when the robot is moving forward
  - Stop the movement of the robot when an obstacle is detected at less than 10 cm
  - Reduce the speed of the robot progressively when an obstacle is detected at less than 20 cm
  - Generate acoustic signals depending on the proximity of the obstacle
  - Communication with a device (PC or mobile phone), which includes receiving commands
  - Bluetooth communication with a mobile phone that controls the robot movement

All the rest of the documentation is in the Report document, where a block diagram, flowcharts and description of the peripherals can be found
